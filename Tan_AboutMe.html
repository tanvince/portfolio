                        <p>As a competitive runner, competitive swimmer, a pianist, a student, and an amateur coder, I strive for a career in Biomedical Engineering. 
                        I plan to achieve obtaining this career by working hard in school and joining engineering clubs like robotics that require hands-on engineering. 
                        This is my ideal career because I crave challenges. Biomedical Engineering requires critical thinking as well as having multiple skills including 
                        coding and engineering. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A career in engineering requires teamwork and cooperation. As a member of multiple sports teams and clubs, I have obtained the skill to be
                        cooperative. In order to succeed, engineers would have to share ideas and criticize other engineers to formulate the best overall idea. Just like in 
                        robotics, everyone must cooperate with each other in order to succeed in tournaments and competitions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Some achievements I obtained in high school: I maintained Principal's Honor Roll for both semesters in freshman year, I swam in the Dublin High Swimming 
                        team freshman year, I ran for the Dublin High Cross Country team sophomore year and I am an active member in the California Scholarship Federation and Patch Club. 
                        Doing all of these extracurricular activities, I learned that I am fearless, a risk taker, and diligent. I take everything that I do seriously and with intention, 
                        an important skill when doing multiple clubs and activities.</p>
