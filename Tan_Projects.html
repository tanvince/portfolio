                <h4>March 8, 2018 - March 26, 2018. Computer Science/Engineering</h4>
                <p>In this Image Manipulation project, my partner Wasi and I used the computer language Python to change the way an image looked. The project objective was to create a product 
                logo that would be memorable and aesthetic to consumers. The original image we used was an image of a Tesla car. We then added code to create many different variations 
                of the car, one making a purple rectangular border, one making a red elliptical border and another making the car a silhouette. We also added code to make the car an overlay
                and works well with background images. This code is not limited to just work on the car, however, as it can work with any product logo or image.  With the simplistic and 
                aesthtic design, this code will make the company who owns the logo satisfied. During the project we encountered many challenges, many of them being the code did not work with the workspace 
                and focusing on what the company wanted, not what worked for us. Wasi and I split the workload; I worked on the borders while Wasi worked on the overlay and silhouette. Overall,
                I learned how to create minimalistic yet aesthetic designs working with Python and negotiating with the company on what we could do and what was possible.</p>

                <h4>September 19, 2017 - October 5, 2017. Computer Science/Engineering</h4>
                <p>The "Photo Booth" app was my second project and I used Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 
                App Inventor to create this. I was given a tutorial to start the code for the app, but I had to build on the tutorial. 
                I worked with a partner, Wasi Alam, and we both were challenged to add more ideas to the application. App Inventor 
                was very similar to Scratch, but had different codes to allow for building applications. After a couple of weeks of coding, 
                Wasi and I were able to create an application that allows the user to take a picture using the device's front and back facing 
                camera and edit the picture using colors and lines. On the opening page, there is a camera icon on the top to open the camera application. 
                After taking the picture, the picture is stored on one of the four canvases. There is an edit button that allows the user 
                to go to another page where they can edit the picture they had taken with the camera application, choosing between different colors to apply 
                onto the picture. Overall this was a successful project and we were able to implement everything we wanted into the application. During this project, 
                I learned that code does not always show up as I wanted it to and there were many cases of trial and error. Making an application was also difficult, so 
                perserverance allowed me and Wasi to successfully code the app.</p>

                <h4>August 29, 2017 - September 7, 2017. Computer Science/Engineering</h4>
                <p>The Maze Game was my first project in Computer Science/Engineering. I worked with Ibraheem Syed using Scratch, a coding platform for coding 
                games, to code this project. This being my first project, there was a lot of trial and error to understand what I was coding. The goal of this game is to 
                complete all of the mazes before the countdown timer ends, challenging the player to quickly find a way through the mazes. In the making of this project, I learned 
                the skill to make code as specific as possible so the finished product will be almost as exactly as planned. I also learned to skill to program moving elements, a skill that 
                might be necessary in the future where I build applications.</p>
